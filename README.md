# CMS-Wafer-Testing
Contents of this project:
  - Jupyter and python scripts to analyze and compare the frequency of errors in wafer testing
  - Jupyter and python scripts to analyze the contact resistance over time of a wafer test
  - Jupyter and python scripts to map the topography (contact height) and symmetry (coming soon) of wafers
  - Jupyter script to compare errors and contact resistance for wafers

This code is intended to be used for analysis of RD53B chips tested on wafers for the CMS HL-LHC upgrade and was written as part of the CMS MREFC EPO 2024 internship at Kansas State University. More information can be found at https://gitlab.cern.ch/croc_testing/croc_wlt.
